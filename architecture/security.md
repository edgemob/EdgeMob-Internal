**Title: Security Architecture and Implementation for Mobile Operator App in AI-Powered Decentralized API Gateway**

### **1. Introduction**

The **Mobile Operator App** in the **AI-Powered Decentralized API Gateway** processes sensitive API transactions while running on decentralized mobile nodes. Ensuring **security, data integrity, and trust** is paramount. This document outlines the **security measures, cryptographic mechanisms, and blockchain-based verification models** implemented to prevent **data breaches, unauthorized access, and malicious activities**.

***

### **2. Core Security Principles**

* **Zero Trust Model**: Every node and API transaction must be authenticated and verified.
* **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: Ensures secure communication across nodes.
* **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Uses blockchain-based authentication to prevent impersonation.
* **Tamper-Resistant Execution**: Implements **Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)** to prevent device-level compromises.
* **AI-Based Threat Detection**: Predicts and blocks malicious activity in real time.

***

### **3. Authentication & Identity Management**

#### **3.1 Web3 Wallet Authentication**

* Users log in using **non-custodial wallets** (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger, etc.).
* The wallet address serves as a **unique decentralized identifier (DID)**.
* Blockchain-based identity verification prevents phishing attacks.

#### **3.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

* **Default MFA Mechanisms**:
  * **Wallet Signature + PIN Verification**.
  * **Optional Biometric Authentication (Face ID / Fingerprint)**.
* **Security Policy:** Users with high stakes must enable **MFA for critical transactions** (withdrawals, governance votes, security setting changes).

#### **3.3 Blockchain-Based Identity Verification**

| **Security Mechanism**                             | **Purpose**                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI)** | Prevents unauthorized nodes from impersonating legitimate ones.     |
| **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**                    | Verifies identity and transactions without exposing sensitive data. |
| **On-Chain Reputation Scoring**                    | Evaluates node trustworthiness based on historical performance.     |

### **4. Secure Communication Protocols**

#### **4.1 End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**

* **All communication between nodes and clients** is encrypted using:
  * **AES-256** for symmetric encryption.
  * **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** for asymmetric encryption.
  * **Noise Protocol Framework** for secure peer-to-peer communication.

#### **4.2 Secure Peer-to-Peer Communication**

* **WebRTC + libp2p** for encrypted node-to-node messaging.
* **TLS 1.3 with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)** ensures secure API request transmission.
* **Ephemeral Key Exchange** prevents replay attacks and MITM attacks.

#### **4.3 Secure API Transactions**

* **API request payloads are cryptographically signed** before transmission.
* Nodes verify **API integrity using Merkle Trees** stored on **IPFS or Arweave**.
* **Replay attack prevention**: Uses timestamped cryptographic nonces.

### **5. Secure Execution & Tamper Resistance**

#### **5.1 Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)**

* Mobile nodes utilize **TEE (e.g., ARM TrustZone, Apple Secure Enclave)** to execute API workloads securely.
* Ensures **isolation from OS-level threats** and prevents unauthorized code modification.
* Secure boot verification ensures that only **signed, untampered software** runs.

#### **5.2 Secure Multi-Party Computation (sMPC)**

* Splits sensitive computation across multiple nodes, ensuring **no single node can access full data**.
* Used for **handling confidential API transactions** (e.g., financial APIs, identity verification APIs).

#### **5.3 Blockchain-Based Execution Integrity**

| **Security Mechanism**              | **Purpose**                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Remote Attestation**              | Ensures only verified software executes on nodes. |
| **On-Chain Proof-of-Execution**     | Logs completed API transactions immutably.        |
| **AI-Powered Execution Monitoring** | Detects anomalies and potential node compromise.  |
