| **Device Binding**              | API keys are **tied to a specific device signature**, preventing key reuse.                                     |
| **HMAC Signature Verification** | API requests require cryptographic **HMAC signing** for authentication.                                         |
| **Zero Trust API Access**       | API keys are not stored on the client; instead, secure **token-based authentication** (OAuth 2.0, JWT) is used. |
