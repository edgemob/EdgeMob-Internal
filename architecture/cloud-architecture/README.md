# Cloud Architecture

#### **Internal Architecture of API Management Solutions**

The internal architecture of **Apigee, AWS API Gateway, and Azure API Management (APIM)** consists of multiple layers and components that handle **request processing, security, traffic management, and analytics**. Each platform is designed to be scalable, secure, and optimized for cloud environments.

***

### **1. Apigee (Google Cloud) Internal Architecture**

**Apigee** is built on a **microservices-based architecture** running on **Google Cloud Kubernetes (GKE)** and **BigQuery** for analytics.

#### **Key Components:**

1. **API Gateway (Edge Router)**
   * Entry point for API traffic.
   * Handles authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
   * Routes requests to the appropriate backend services.
2. **Traffic Manager**
   * Implements throttling, quotas, and caching.
   * Optimizes API traffic for performance and cost efficiency.
3. **Security & Policy Engine**
   * Applies security policies (OAuth, JWT, API Keys, TLS/SSL).
   * Validates requests and enforces compliance.
4. **Analytics & Logging**
   * Uses **Google BigQuery** for real-time API analytics.
   * Stores request/response logs for monitoring and debugging.
5. **Developer Portal**
   * Provides API documentation and self-service subscription management.
   * Allows API monetization and marketplace integration.
6. **Backend Services (Proxy Layer)**
   * Translates external API calls to internal service requests.
   * Supports REST, SOAP, and GraphQL backends.

#### **Underlying Technologies:**

* **Kubernetes (GKE)** â€“ Containerized deployment of API services.
* **BigQuery** â€“ API analytics and logging.
* **Google Cloud Functions** â€“ Serverless execution of API logic.
* **Istio Service Mesh** â€“ Manages API traffic and observability.

### **2. AWS API Gateway Internal Architecture**

**AWS API Gateway** is **cloud-native and serverless**, deeply integrated into **AWS Lambda, IAM, and CloudFront**.

#### **Key Components:**

1. **API Gateway (Edge Layer)**
   * Handles request validation, authentication, and rate limiting.
   * Routes traffic to backend services.
2. **Authorization & Security Layer**
   * Uses **AWS IAM, Cognito, API Keys, OAuth 2.0, JWT**.
   * Applies AWS WAF for threat protection.
3. **Integration Layer**
   * Routes API requests to **AWS Lambda, EC2, Fargate, DynamoDB, or RDS**.
   * Supports **HTTP, WebSockets, and RESTful APIs**.
4. **Traffic Control & Caching**
   * Uses **Amazon CloudFront** for API caching and edge distribution.
   * Implements throttling and quotas via **AWS API Gateway policies**.
5. **Logging & Monitoring**
   * **AWS CloudWatch** for logging API requests.
   * **AWS X-Ray** for distributed tracing.
6. **API Deployment & Versioning**
   * API Stages (e.g., Dev, Test, Prod).
   * CI/CD integration using AWS CodePipeline.

#### **Underlying Technologies:**

* **AWS Lambda** â€“ Serverless backend processing.
* **CloudFront** â€“ API caching and global content delivery.
* **DynamoDB & RDS** â€“ Backend data storage.
* **AWS WAF** â€“ API security and DDoS protection.

### **3. Azure API Management (APIM) Internal Architecture**

**Azure API Management** follows a **distributed, multi-layered architecture**, optimized for **hybrid deployments**.

#### **Key Components:**

1. **API Gateway**
   * Acts as the central entry point for all API requests.
   * Handles authentication, caching, and policy enforcement.
2. **Policy Engine**
   * Uses XML-based **policy definitions** to apply transformations and security rules.
   * Supports **OAuth2, Azure AD, JWT validation**.
3. **Developer Portal**
   * A self-service API catalog for developers.
   * Allows API subscription, documentation, and analytics.
4. **Analytics & Logging**
   * Uses **Azure Monitor & Application Insights** for performance tracking.
   * Stores API request logs for debugging.
5. **Traffic Management & Caching**
   * Implements **Azure Front Door** for global API distribution.
   * Supports request throttling and rate limiting.
6. **Backend Integration Layer**
   * Connects APIs to **Azure Functions, Kubernetes, Logic Apps, or SQL Databases**.
   * Supports **on-premise API integration** using **Azure Arc**.

#### **Underlying Technologies:**

* **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** â€“ API microservices deployment.
* **Azure Front Door** â€“ Edge caching and global traffic management.
* **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)** â€“ Enterprise-grade security.
* **Terraform & ARM Templates** â€“ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automation.
