# Use-cases

**Title: Use Cases for AI-Powered Decentralized API Gateway**

### **1. Introduction**

The AI-Powered Decentralized API Gateway serves as a highly efficient and intelligent API management system for Web3 developers, enterprises, and AI-driven applications. Below are the key use cases and their detailed workflows.

***

### **2. Use Case Scenarios & User Flow**

#### **2.1 Decentralized Web3 Authentication & API Access**

**Scenario:** A dApp wants to authenticate users without relying on traditional centralized authentication systems.

**User Flow:**

1. User visits the dApp and selects "Login with Web3 Wallet."
2. The dApp redirects the user to sign a message using MetaMask or WalletConnect.
3. The AI-Powered API Gateway verifies the signed message (SIWE - Sign-In With Ethereum).
4. A temporary access token is issued to the user.
5. The user can now access secured API endpoints.

***

#### **2.2 AI-Optimized DeFi Trading Bots**

**Scenario:** A trader wants to run an AI-powered bot to automate trading strategies across DeFi protocols.

**User Flow:**

1. Trader registers on the API Gateway and stakes tokens for bot access.
2. Trader selects an AI-powered trading bot API.
3. The API Gateway routes the request to the best-performing AI node.
4. The AI bot continuously analyzes the market and executes trades.
5. Profits/losses are tracked in real-time, and the trader can adjust parameters.

***

#### **2.3 Decentralized Storage Access for dApps**

**Scenario:** A decentralized application wants to store user-generated content securely using IPFS or Arweave.

**User Flow:**

1. Developer integrates the API Gateway with their dApp.
2. User uploads content via the dApp.
3. The API Gateway optimally routes the storage request to an IPFS or Arweave node.
4. The file is stored on a decentralized network.
5. The user is provided with a **permanent content hash (CID)** to retrieve their file anytime.

***

#### **2.4 AI-Powered Smart Contract Audits**

**Scenario:** A blockchain project wants to audit a smart contract before deployment.

**User Flow:**

1. Developer submits the smart contract source code via the API Gateway.
2. AI-powered analysis scans the contract for vulnerabilities.
3. A detailed security report is generated.
4. Developers receive recommendations for fixing security flaws.
5. Once fixed, the contract is **re-audited and approved**.

***

#### **2.5 AI-Powered API Monetization for Developers**

**Scenario:** A developer wants to publish and monetize their AI-based API services.

**User Flow:**

1. Developer registers an API on the decentralized API marketplace.
2. They set pricing, rate limits, and staking requirements.
3. Consumers discover and integrate the API into their applications.
4. API calls are routed optimally through the AI-powered API Gateway.
5. Developer earns **token-based revenue** based on API consumption.
