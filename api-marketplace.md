* Edge computing for reduced latency and real-time processing.

#### **2.2 Tokenized API Monetization**

* Developers can charge per request, subscription, or staking-based access.
* Smart contract-powered payments ensure secure transactions.
* AI-driven dynamic pricing adjusts fees based on demand and network conditions.

#### **2.3 AI-Powered API Discovery & Recommendations**

* AI-based search engine helps users find the most relevant APIs.
* Personalized recommendations based on past usage patterns.
* Predictive analytics suggest high-demand APIs to developers.

#### **2.4 Web3 Authentication & Access Control**

* Supports **Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE), WalletConnect, and OAuth 2.0**.
* Role-based access for different API consumption levels.
* Token staking for premium API access and priority execution.

#### **2.5 Security & Fraud Prevention**

* AI-based anomaly detection to prevent API abuse.
* Blockchain-powered audit logs ensure data integrity.
* Decentralized identity verification for API consumers and providers.

### **3. How It Works**

#### **3.1 For API Developers**

2. Uploads API endpoints and **sets pricing/staking requirements**.
3. Smart contract handles **tokenized payments** and access control.
4. AI suggests improvements and optimizes API placement.
5. Developers earn tokens based on API usage and staking models.

#### **3.2 For API Consumers**

1. User **browses the marketplace** and selects an API.
2. Pays via **tokens, staking, or subscription model**.
3. AI dynamically routes API requests to the best-performing node.
4. Consumers receive **real-time analytics** on API usage.
5. API access is **secured via Web3 authentication**.
