### **3. System Architecture Overview**

#### **3.1 High-Level Architecture**

The **AI-Powered Decentralized API Gateway** is designed with a modular, decentralized, and AI-enhanced architecture. Unlike traditional API gateways that rely on **centralized cloud servers**, this solution leverages **distributed edge nodes, mobile-based API processing, and blockchain-backed governance**.

The system is composed of the following core components:

1. **Decentralized API Nodes**: A network of nodes, running on **edge servers, mobile devices, and decentralized cloud platforms** such as Akash Network.
2. **AI-Powered Traffic Management Layer**: Uses **machine learning models** for **real-time load balancing, caching, and routing decisions**.
3. **Protocol Transformation Engine**: Converts API requests dynamically between **REST, gRPC, GraphQL, WebSockets, MQTT, JSON-RPC, and Web3 protocols**.
4. **Blockchain-Integrated Security & Governance**: Implements **on-chain API policy enforcement, access control, and rate limiting** via smart contracts.
5. **API Monetization & Tokenization Layer**: Enables **crypto-based API access, staking models, and revenue-sharing mechanisms**.
