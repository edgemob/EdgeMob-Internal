#### **9.2 Challenges with Traditional API Optimization & Analytics**

| **Challenge**                     | **Traditional API Gateways (AWS API Gateway, Kong, Apigee, Cloudflare Workers)** |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Static Load Balancing**         | Fixed rule-based policies lead to inefficient traffic distribution.              |
| **Limited Performance Analytics** | Basic metrics on API usage; lacks predictive analytics.                          |
| **Manual API Scaling**            | Requires human intervention to adjust API capacity.                              |
| **Slow Anomaly Detection**        | Relies on pre-configured alerts; delayed attack mitigation.                      |
| **No AI-Based Adaptive Caching**  | Cache policies are static, leading to unnecessary latency.                       |
