# Mobile Node Infrastructure

### **4. Mobile Node Infrastructure - Technical Implementation**

#### **4.1 Overview**

The **Mobile Node Infrastructure** is the backbone of EdgeMob.AI’s decentralized execution model. It enables **mobile devices to act as API processing nodes**, reducing reliance on centralized cloud services while improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

#### **4.2 Key Features**

✅ **Decentralized API Execution** – Mobile devices act as independent API execution nodes, reducing cloud dependency.\
✅ **Dynamic Node Discovery** – Nodes register and deregister based on network conditions, availability, and device health.\
✅ **Blockchain-Based Verification** – Each node’s performance is logged on-chain for transparency and trustworthiness.\
✅ **Token-Based Incentives** – Nodes earn **EGMO tokens** for processing API requests, encouraging participation.\
✅ **Device-Agnostic Compatibility** – Supports Android, iOS, and Linux-based devices.\
✅ **Secure Enclaves for Execution** – Protects API data by leveraging **TEE (Trusted Execution Environments)** on mobile devices.

#### **4.3 System Components & Architecture**

**4.3.1 Node Registration & Authentication**

* Each node **registers with a unique cryptographic identity** stored on-chain.
* Nodes **stake EGMO tokens** to participate in API execution.
* AI assigns requests based on **performance, uptime, and latency metrics**.

**4.3.2 API Execution & Communication**

* Nodes process API requests and return responses **via libp2p and WebSockets**.
* AI dynamically selects nodes based on **resource availability and execution speed**.
* API logs are stored on **IPFS for decentralized traceability**.

**4.3.3 Security Mechanisms**

* **End-to-End Encryption** – Ensures secure API execution without exposing data.
* **TEE Integration (Trusted Execution Environment)** – Protects sensitive computations.
* **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs)** – Verifies execution integrity without revealing request details.
