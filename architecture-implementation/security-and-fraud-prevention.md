# Security & fraud Prevention

**Title: Security & Fraud Prevention - Technical Implementation**

### **1. Introduction**

The **Security & Fraud Prevention** module in EdgeMob.AI ensures the **integrity, confidentiality, and availability** of the decentralized API ecosystem. Given the **decentralized nature of mobile-powered API execution**, security is a critical component to protect **API transactions, user data, mobile nodes, and tokenized payments** from various attacks such as **DDoS, Sybil attacks, API abuse, and fraudulent activities**.

### **4. Technical Implementation**

#### **4.1 Decentralized Identity & Authentication (DID)**

* Implements **blockchain-based identity (DID)** to eliminate centralized identity storage risks.
* Users and API providers **sign transactions using cryptographic keys**, ensuring authenticity.
* **MFA-enabled logins** are enforced for higher security API transactions.

#### **4.2 Encryption & Secure API Execution**

* **End-to-end encryption (E2EE)** is enforced at multiple layers:
  * TLS 1.3 secures **API transmission**.
  * AES-256 encryption protects **stored API data**.
  * Secure enclaves (TEE) enable **trusted execution on mobile nodes**.
* **zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Proofs)** allow nodes to process requests **without revealing user-sensitive data**.

#### **4.3 Rate Limiting & Anti-DDoS Mechanism**

* AI models **detect rapid spikes in API traffic**, preventing DDoS attempts.
* Smart contracts implement **request-based staking** to **deter spam API calls**.
* Nodes with repeated abusive behavior **lose staked EGMO tokens**.

#### **4.4 Fraud Detection & Anomaly Prevention**

* AI-driven fraud detection monitors:
  * **Repeated failed API requests**.
  * **Unusual transaction behavior** (API usage spikes, token withdrawals).
  * **Attempts to bypass rate limits**.
* Automated blacklisting **removes compromised nodes from execution pools**.

#### **4.5 Reputation-Based Node Trust Model**

* Nodes **stake EGMO tokens** to participate in API execution.
* Reputation scoring is based on:
  * **Uptime & successful API execution rate**.
  * **Consumer reviews & API performance consistency**.
  * **Absence of fraudulent activity**.
* Low-reputation nodes face **temporary bans or reduced API execution privileges**.

#### **4.6 Blockchain Security Logging & Audits**

* API transactions are **cryptographically signed** and stored **immutably on-chain**.
* Consumers can **verify API request integrity** via smart contract logs.
* **DAO-based security reviews** allow the community to assess node behaviors.
