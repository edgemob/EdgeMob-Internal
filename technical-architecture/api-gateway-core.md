# API Gateway Core

**Title: Detailed Technical Documentation on API Gateway Core**

### **1. Introduction**

The **API Gateway Core** serves as the foundational component of the AI-powered decentralized API Gateway. It is responsible for **managing API traffic, optimizing request routing, enforcing security, and ensuring high availability**. This document provides a detailed technical overview of the API Gateway Core, including its architecture, components, request lifecycle, and performance optimizations.

### **2. Core Responsibilities**

The API Gateway Core handles:

* **Request Processing & Routing**: Directing API requests to the optimal mobile node or backend service.
* **Authentication & Access Control**: Enforcing Web3 authentication and API key validation.
* **AI-Powered Load Balancing**: Optimizing API traffic distribution.
* **Security & Rate Limiting**: Preventing abuse through adaptive rate limiting and AI-driven anomaly detection.
* **Caching & Optimization**: Accelerating API responses through AI-driven caching.
* **Monitoring & Analytics**: Providing real-time API usage insights and performance tracking.

### **3. Architectural Overview**

The API Gateway Core consists of the following key components:

#### **3.1 API Request Handler**

* Manages incoming API requests and forwards them to the correct backend.
* Supports multiple protocols (HTTP, WebSockets, gRPC).
* Implements **AI-driven smart routing** for optimal request distribution.

#### **3.2 AI-Optimized Load Balancer**

* Uses **reinforcement learning models** to dynamically adjust traffic routing.
* Selects the **best-performing** node based on latency, uptime, and computational capacity.
* Predicts **network congestion** and preemptively adjusts routing.

#### **3.3 Authentication & Security Layer**

* Supports **Web3 authentication** (Sign-In With Ethereum, WalletConnect, OAuth 2.0).
* Implements **JWT and API key authentication** for Web2 compatibility.
* AI-powered **anomaly detection** to prevent fraudulent API usage.

#### **3.4 Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection**

* AI-based **adaptive rate limiting** adjusts API access based on user behavior.
* Detects abnormal spikes in traffic and blocks potential DDoS attacks.
* Uses **machine learning models** to identify malicious API consumers.

#### **3.5 AI-Powered Caching & CDN Layer**

* Predictive caching **preloads frequently accessed API responses**.
* Edge caching ensures low-latency responses for mobile nodes.
* AI dynamically manages cache expiration based on **usage patterns**.

#### **3.6 Monitoring & Analytics Engine**

* Logs **API traffic, response times, error rates, and security events**.
* AI-powered **trend analysis** predicts traffic spikes and optimizes resource allocation.
* Real-time **dashboard with visual analytics** for developers and node operators.

### **4. API Request Lifecycle**

1. **Client Sends API Request**: The request reaches the API Gateway.
2. **Authentication & Validation**: API Gateway verifies the request's authentication credentials.
3. **AI Routing Decision**: AI-based load balancer selects the best node or backend.
4. **Security Checks**: DDoS protection and anomaly detection mechanisms analyze the request.
5. **Cache Lookup & Optimization**: If cached, the response is returned instantly; otherwise, the request is forwarded.
6. **Backend Processing**: The target API node processes the request and returns the response.
7. **Response Optimization**: AI-based compression and encryption ensure an optimized API response.
8. **Monitoring & Logging**: API logs are recorded for future analytics and security tracking.
