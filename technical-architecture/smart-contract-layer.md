# Smart Contract Layer

**Title: Technical Documentation for Smart Contract Layer in API Gateway**

### **1. Introduction**

The **Smart Contract Layer** is a critical component of the **AI-Powered Decentralized API Gateway**, enabling **trustless API access control, automated payments, tokenized incentives, and decentralized governance**. This document outlines the **technical architecture, functionalities, workflows, and implementation details** of the smart contract layer.

### **2. Core Functionalities of the Smart Contract Layer**

#### **2.1 API Access Control**

* Implements **role-based access control (RBAC)** for API consumers.
* Supports **token-staking mechanisms** for priority API access.
* Enforces **usage quotas and rate limits** through on-chain policies.

#### **2.2 Automated Payment & Settlements**

* Tokenized API payments executed via **smart contracts**.
* Supports multiple pricing models: **pay-per-request, subscription-based, and staking-based access**.
* On-chain ledger records **API usage and payment transactions**.

#### **2.3 Node Operator Incentive Model**

* Smart contracts **reward mobile node operators** for API processing.
* Rewards are distributed based on **uptime, reliability, and performance**.
* Implements **slashing mechanisms** to penalize unreliable nodes.

#### **2.4 Decentralized Governance**

* Enables **DAO-based governance** where token holders vote on network upgrades.
* Smart contracts control **API pricing adjustments and protocol changes**.
* Community-driven decision-making via on-chain voting.

### **3. Smart Contract Architecture**

#### **3.1 Key Smart Contracts**

| **Contract Name**      | **Functionality**                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **AccessControl.sol**  | Manages API consumer permissions and rate limits.                  |
| **PaymentGateway.sol** | Handles tokenized API payments and subscription models.            |
| **NodeReward.sol**     | Distributes rewards to mobile node operators based on performance. |
| **GovernanceDAO.sol**  | Implements decentralized voting and proposal management.           |

#### **3.2 Smart Contract Interaction Workflow**

1. **User Requests API Access**: Calls API Gateway with a blockchain-signed request.
2. **Smart Contract Validates Access**: Checks user token balance and stake.
3. **Request Processed by Mobile Node**: If valid, the request is forwarded.
4. **Automated Payment Execution**: Fees are deducted based on API usage.
5. **Node Rewards Distributed**: Tokens are sent to node operators.
6. **Governance Updates**: Token holders vote on upgrades and fee structures.

### **4. Tokenomics & Economic Model**

#### **4.1 Token Utility**

* **Payment for API Requests**: Users pay in tokens for API consumption.
* **Staking for Access**: Users stake tokens for premium API access.
* **Node Rewards**: Tokens are distributed to node operators based on API processing contributions.
* **Governance Voting Power**: Token holders can vote on protocol changes.

#### **4.2 Fee Model**

| **Transaction**                | **Fee Mechanism**                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| API Call Payment               | Pay-per-use or subscription-based token deduction.  |
| Node Rewards                   | Dynamic token distribution based on API processing. |
| Governance Proposal Submission | Requires token staking for proposal creation.       |

### **5. Security & Compliance**

* **Access Control Enforcement**: Prevents unauthorized API access.
* **Automated Rate Limiting**: Protects against excessive API consumption.
* **Immutable Payment Ledger**: Ensures transaction integrity.
* **Audited Smart Contracts**: Regular security audits to prevent vulnerabilities.

### **6. Technology Stack**

| **Component**           | **Technology**                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Smart Contracts**     | Solidity, CosmWasm                    |
| **Blockchain Network**  | Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Cosmos SDK |
| **Authentication**      | SIWE, WalletConnect, OAuth 2.0        |
| **On-Chain Governance** | Snapshot, Aragon, DAOstack            |
| **Token Standards**     | ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155             |

### **7. Conclusion**

The **Smart Contract Layer** establishes a **secure, automated, and decentralized** foundation for API management, ensuring **trustless API payments, access control, and governance**. By integrating **staking, incentives, and governance mechanisms**, it creates a **scalable and self-sustaining** Web3 API ecosystem.
