# Gateway Configurations

**Title: Configuration Management in the AI-Powered Decentralized API Gateway**

### **1. Introduction**

The **AI-Powered Decentralized API Gateway** allows users to configure various settings to optimize **performance, security, monetization, and network efficiency**. This document outlines all key configurations and how they are set within the decentralized API gateway.

### **2. Key API Gateway Configurations**

#### **2.1 Load Balancing & Traffic Routing**

* **AI-Driven Load Balancer**: Configured using **reinforcement learning models**.
* **Geo-Region Routing**: Configures edge node selection based on **latency and network congestion**.
* **Adaptive Failover Policies**: Defines threshold rules for switching nodes during failures.

#### **2.2 Security & Authentication**

* **Web3 Authentication**: Supports **SIWE, WalletConnect, and OAuth 2.0**.
* **Rate Limiting Rules**: Configures max requests per API key, token, or user.
* **Anomaly Detection**: AI-based security scanning rules for identifying suspicious API calls.

#### **2.3 API Monetization & Access Control**

* **Token-Based Access**: Defines staking requirements for API consumers.
* **Dynamic Pricing Model**: AI adjusts API call costs based on demand and node availability.
* **Subscription-Based Access**: Enables API providers to offer subscription tiers.

#### **2.4 Caching & Performance Optimization**

* **Predictive Caching**: Configures AI to pre-cache frequently requested API responses.
* **Edge Caching Rules**: Defines caching policies at mobile and decentralized edge nodes.
* **Compression & Encryption Settings**: Configures payload optimization for high-speed delivery.

#### **2.5 Node Operator Configurations**

* **Resource Allocation Rules**: Sets CPU, memory, and bandwidth limits for mobile-based nodes.
* **Node Performance Rewards**: Configures staking incentives and penalties for node operators.
* **Auto-Scaling Policies**: AI-driven adjustments for scaling edge nodes based on API demand.

#### **2.6 Governance & Decentralized Control**

* **DAO Voting Mechanisms**: Enables governance proposals and token-based voting.
* **Proposal Execution Rules**: Configures how governance-approved updates are implemented.
* **Governance Fee Structure**: Defines the fee model for on-chain decision-making.

### **3. How Configurations Are Set**

#### **3.1 Configuration via Smart Contracts**

* API access, pricing, and authentication settings are stored on **Ethereum, Solana, or Cosmos SDK smart contracts**.
* On-chain governance **updates these configurations dynamically** through DAO voting.

#### **3.2 AI-Based Auto-Configuration**

* AI continuously **adjusts load balancing, pricing, and caching** configurations in real-time.
* Uses **machine learning models to predict optimal configurations** based on historical data.

#### **3.3 Decentralized Node Configuration Management**

* Node operators configure hardware and network parameters through **staking smart contracts**.
* AI automatically **assigns API requests based on node performance metrics**.

#### **3.4 Developer & User Dashboard Configuration**

* API providers can configure **rate limits, authentication modes, and pricing models** via a **Web3 dashboard**.
* Users can **customize API access preferences** through **blockchain-signed settings**.

### **4. Technology Stack for Configuration Management**
